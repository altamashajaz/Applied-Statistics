## Introduction

In this project, we perform a detailed analysis of customer purchasing behavior using descriptive statistics. The analysis includes various statistical methods to uncover insights from the data that can help in making informed marketing decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information and purchasing behavior. It includes various features such as:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Income**: Annual income of the customer
- **Marital Status**: Marital status of the customer
- **MntWines**: Amount spent on wine in the last 2 years
- **MntFruits**: Amount spent on fruits in the last 2 years
- **MntMeatProducts**: Amount spent on meat in the last 2 years
- **MntFishProducts**: Amount spent on fish in the last 2 years
- **MntSweetProducts**: Amount spent on sweets in the last 2 years
- **MntGoldProds**: Amount spent on gold products in the last 2 years
- **NumDealsPurchases**: Number of purchases made with a discount
- **NumWebPurchases**: Number of purchases made through the company‚Äôs website
- **NumCatalogPurchases**: Number of purchases made using a catalogue
- **NumStorePurchases**: Number of purchases made directly in stores
- **NumWebVisitsMonth**: Number of visits to the company‚Äôs website in the last month

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. The steps include:

1. **Loading the dataset**: Reading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Handling missing values**: Identifying and dealing with missing data.
3. **Data transformation**: Transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset better. This involves:

1. **Descriptive statistics**: Calculating mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
2. **Data visualization**: Creating various plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the distribution and relationships in the data.
   - Histograms
   - Box plots
   - Scatter plots
   - Correlation matrix

## Statistical Analysis

In this section, we apply statistical methods to draw inferences from the data:

1. **Correlation analysis**: Analyzing the correlation between different variables to identify significant relationships.
2. **Hypothesis testing**: Conducting hypothesis tests to validate assumptions and draw conclusions.
3. **Regression analysis**: Performing regression analysis to understand the impact of different factors on the target variable.

## Conclusion

The analysis provided insights into customer purchasing behavior, which can help the company optimize its marketing strategies. Key findings include significant correlations between certain demographic variables and purchasing patterns.
